Notes:
The STP PortFast BPDU guard enhancement allows network designers to enforce the STP domain borders and keep the active topology predictable. 
The devices behind the ports that have STP PortFast enabled are not able to influence the STP topology. At the reception of BPDUs, 
the BPDU guard operation disables the port that has PortFast configured. The BPDU guard transitions the port into errdisable state, and a message appears on the console.
