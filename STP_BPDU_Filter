Note:
The STP BPDU filter feature allows control of spanning tree participation on a per-port basis. It can be used to exclude specific ports from becoming part of spanning tree 
operations. A port with the BPDU filter enabled will ignore incoming BPDU packets and stay locked in the spanning tree forwarding state. All other ports will maintain their role.
