Note:
When used, backbone fast must be enabled on all switches in the network because backbone fast requires the use of the RLQ Request and Reply mechanism in order to inform switches of root path stability. 
The RLQ protocol is active only when backbone fast is enabled on a switch. In addition, the network can also run into issues with RLQ flooding, 
if backbone fast is not enabled on all switches. By default, backbone fast is disabled.

Backbone fast is not supported on Catalyst 2900XL and 3500XL switches. In general, 
you need to enable backbone fast if the switch domain contains these switches in addition to other supporting Catalyst switches. 
When you implement backbone fast in environments with XL switches, under strict topologies, 
you can enable the feature where the XL switch is the last switch in line and is only connected to the core at two places. 
Do not implement this feature if the architecture of the XL switches is in daisy-chain fashion.

You do not need to configure backbone fast with RSTP or IEEE 802.1w because the mechanism is natively included and automatically enabled in RSTP.
