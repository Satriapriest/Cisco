Note:
The administrator can set the root bridge priority to 0 in an effort to secure the root bridge position. 
But there is no guarantee against a bridge with a priority of 0 and a lower MAC address.

The root guard feature provides a way to enforce the root bridge placement in the network.

The root guard ensures that the port on which root guard is enabled is the designated port. Normally, root bridge ports are all designated ports, 
unless two or more ports of the root bridge are connected together. If the bridge receives superior STP Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs) on a root guard-enabled port,
root guard moves this port to a root-inconsistent STP state. This root-inconsistent state is effectively equal to a listening state.
No traffic is forwarded across this port. In this way, the root guard enforces the position of the root bridge.
