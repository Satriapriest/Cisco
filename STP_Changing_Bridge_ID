---SPANNING-TREE CHANGING BRIDGE ID---

You can also change the priority of a port to make it the root port. When the spanning tree topology is based on default parameters, 
the path between the source and the destination stations in a switched network might not be ideal. The goal is to make the fastest link the root port, 
connecting higher-speed links to a port that has a higher number than the current root port can cause a root-port change.

---CONFIGURE WITH ROOT PRIMARY & SECONDARY---
enable
configure terminal
spanning-tree vlan 1 root primary
spanning-tree vlan 1 root secondary

---CONFIGURE WITH PRIORITY VALUE---
enable
configure terminal
spanning-tree vlan 1 priority 4096

Note: Priority values are calculated in multiples of 16.
