---Hello Time---
The hello time is the time between each bridge protocol data unit (BPDU) that is sent on a port. 
This time is equal to 2 seconds (sec) by default, but you can tune the time to be between 1 and 10 sec.

enable
configure terminal
spanning-tree vlan 1 hello-time 5

---Forward Time / Delay---
The forward delay is the time that is spent in the listening and learning state. 
This time is equal to 15 sec by default, but you can tune the time to be between 4 and 30 sec.

enable
configure terminal
spanning-tree vlan 1 forward-time 5

---Max Age---
The max age timer controls the maximum length of time that passes before a bridge port saves its configuration BPDU information. 
This time is 20 sec by default, but you can tune the time to be between 6 and 40 sec.

enable
configure terminal
spanning-tree vlan 1 max-age 10

Each configuration BPDU contains these three parameters. In addition, each BPDU configuration contains another time-related parameter that is known as the message age. 
The message age is not a fixed value. The message age contains the length of time that has passed since the root bridge initially originated the BPDU. 
The root bridge sends all its BPDUs with a message age value of 0, and all subsequent switches add 1 to this value. 
Effectively, this value contains the information on how far you are from the root bridge when you receive a BPDU.
