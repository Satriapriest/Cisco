Notes:
Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a Layer 2 protocol that runs on bridges and switches. The specification for STP is IEEE 802.1D. 
The main purpose of STP is to ensure that you do not create loops when you have redundant paths in your network. Loops are deadly to a network.

1. By default the priority value of STP is 32768 plus VLAN 1 (Depending on the VLAN ID used).
2. The switch will select the path that has the lowest cost. 
If there is a path that has the highest value cost, it will be blocked and become an alternative path (Blocking port).
